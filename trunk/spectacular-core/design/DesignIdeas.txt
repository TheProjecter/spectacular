General flow:

    read minderupt.spectacular.reader.file
    parse html
        get all tables

    for each table found
        determine type - bdd, fit, use case
        store core data in data structure
        store html document with placeholders in data structure as well

    execute tests
        execute them
        store results in data structure

    modify tables to include color for results

    write results to output destination


Design


    DocumentReader
        May need to implement different types for URL-based loading (i.e. from network, from file, from classpath, etc.)
        (X) returns data, string?

    ArtifactExtractor -> HTMLArtifactExtractor
        (X) parses document for common areas where tests belong (tables for first iteration), called Artifact
        (X) returns Document containing linked list of Artifacts
        Add begin and end location #s for artifact so we can reinsert results?

    (X) DecisionerAgent -> ChainedDecisionerAgent
        (X) needs decisioners injected
        (X) decides on type of test, sets flags in Artifact
        (X) returns Document

    Decisioner
        (X) chain of responsibility?
        (X) decides what type of test an entity is
        (X) injected into DecisionerAgent, multiple

    TestExecutor?
        Executes tests
        (X) encapsulates multiple test styles under a single interface
        (X) concrete classes define how to execute BDD/JBehave, EUC, FIT
        Returns results of execution, including raw results and/or updated tables

    Reporting
        Output Possibilities:
            in file (same spec)?
            to console?
            to external service?

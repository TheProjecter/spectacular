#summary Behavior Driven Development with JBehave

= Introduction =

Spectacular uses the popular Java library [http://jbehave.org/ JBehave] as its BDD testing library for fixture development.  For a more in-depth look at how JBehave works, please visit the [http://jbehave.org/documentation/ JBehave documentation] site.

JBehave is [http://jbehave.org/development/team/ written and maintained] by ThoughtWorkers Dan North and Liz Keogh, both of which I have seen talk about BDD and greatly inspired my desire to work on this project.

=Details=

Writing text fixtures for JBehave under Spectacular isn't really very different than with JBehave alone.  Actually, it's a little bit less work because you don't need to create a `org.jbehave.scenario.JUnitScenario` or equivalent.

Just create an annotated `org.jbehave.scenario.Steps` concrete class:

{{{

public class ExampleStepClass extends Steps {

    private static Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(ExampleStepClass.class);

    @Given("some kind of setup")
    public void givenSomeKindOfSetup() {
        LOGGER.info("givenSomeKindOfSetup()"); 
    }

    @When("some kind of action")
    public void givenSomeKindOfAction() {
        LOGGER.info("givenSomeKindOfAction()"); 
    }

    @Then("some kind of assertion")
    public void givenSomeKindOfAssertion() {
        LOGGER.info("givenSomeKindOfAssertion()"); 
    }

    
}


}}}

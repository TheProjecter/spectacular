#summary Behavior Driven Development with JBehave

= Introduction =

Spectacular uses the popular Java library [http://jbehave.org/ JBehave] as its BDD testing library for fixture development.  For a more in-depth look at how JBehave works, please visit the [http://jbehave.org/documentation/ JBehave documentation] site.

JBehave is [http://jbehave.org/development/team/ written and maintained] by ThoughtWorkers Dan North and Liz Keogh, both of which I have seen talk about BDD and greatly inspired my desire to work on this project.

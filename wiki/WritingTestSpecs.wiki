= Introduction =

The whole idea behind Spectacular is that you can write your requirements specifications in whatever format you and your team are comfortable with, while allowing for certain _artifacts_ in your specification to be executable; that is, those _artifacts_ will execute _test fixtures_ which in turn test your software.

=Agile Specifications:  Activities and User Stories=

Agile development has brought a whole new level of extreme productivity to development teams who practice it.  One practice that I really like is of creating _User Stories_ as the basis for requirements.  

One problem I always had with User Stories was using them in a bigger context - the system itself.  Also, how does one organize User Stories under "Epics" and "Themes?"  

The way I now elicit requirements from my teams is to hold a _Persona and Story Mapping Workshop_, a technique heavily borrowed from Dave Hussman and Jeff Patton.  The idea is to have a team brainstorm the users of the system (the "_Personas_") and describe each of the high-level actions those users will perform (the "_Activities_").  Activities are fairly analogous to Use Cases; in fact, that how I treat them with my Agile teams (though, much more lightweight than the traditional types).

For example, an Activity might be described as such (for a members-only blog site) for a Persona called "Story Writer":

  * Log into system
  * Create a new user
  * Post a story

Simple, right?  What does logging into the system entail?  What does it look like in terms of a web-flow?  These are all details that really should be documented (remember: think lightweight!).  Also, there are many permutations of an Activity in most cases.  Take the first couple off our list and split them into _User Stories_:

  * Log into System
    * As a story writer I want to log in so I can manage my content
    * As a story writer I want to log in and remember my credentials so I don't have to enter them each time
    * As a story writer if I enter my credentials incorrectly I should see an error page asking me to try again.

  * Create a new user
    * As a new user I want to register myself so that I can start reviewing stories
    * As a registered user I want to request story-writing privileges so I can start writing stories.

5 stories, all split from 2 activities.  

=Describing Activities and User Stories=

Activities and User Stories are usually described in the form of _tests_ by well-functioning Agile teams.  In my experience, I find tests to be a fantastic way to describe requirements, but it's not always enough.  For web applications with some kind of flow, I like to be able to draw out some simple web flow maps and possibly a bullet-list of business rules that support the activity or user story, in addition to tests.  And, I want them all in one place.  

Enter:  Spectacular.

=Many types of tests, many styles of documentation=

Many organizations will tend to document requirements and tests in their own special way.  Making matters more complicated, each team has its own preferred "testing framework."  However, I find that not 1 testing framework satisfies all my needs for requirements.  All of the testing frameworks I have used are awesome in their own way, but none satisfies me 100%.  So, I want to use them *all*.  :)

=Example Full Requirements for an Activity=

Below is an example document that describes a single Activity/Use Case, supported by a Use-Case Flow and multiple stories with story tests.  

(I used Powerpoint to draw the pictures - don't hate me)

=Activity:  Log Into System=

==Web Flow Storyboard==

==Use Case==

|| Primary Flow:  Logging into system ||
|| *User Activity* || *Expectation* || *Comments* ||
|| User navigates to the system home page || User sees the home page || ||
|| User clicks link to log-in to system || User is presented with a login page requesting credentials || ||
|| User enters credentials and submits form || System logs in user and displays a list of stories published || Assuming user exists and is active ||

  This is an example of an Executable Use Case.  See [WritingExecutableUseCases] for more details.

==User Stories==


===As a story writer I want to log in so I can manage my content===

  * Business Rules
    * Story Writers should see a list of published stories upon logging in
    * Story Writers should have the option to manage their stories on their first screen
    * Logging in should require a username and password


<table border="1">
<tr><td>minderupt.sample.bdd.steps.LoginSteps</td></tr>
<tr><td>
{{{
Scenario: Log in a story writer
  
   Given a user with a username of "StoryWriter" exists
     And a user with a username of "StoryWriter" has a password of "swpwd123"
   When the user logs in with a username of "StoryWriter" and a password of "swpwd123"
   Then the user is logged in
     And the user sees a list of published stories
}}}
</td></tr>

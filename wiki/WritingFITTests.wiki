Details about how to write Gherkin tests can be found [http://jbehave.org/reference/latest/getting-started.html at the JBehave site].  


=Required Elements=

In order for your BDD/Gherkin artifact to be recognized, it must contain the following elements:

  * Must be in a table
  * The first row in the table needs to exist and contain the name of the class which implements the steps in the test.  Note: it is common for a team to write the test first, and follow up by augmenting the document later with a class name.
  * The second row in the table contains your test scenarios.  This follows the standard format for Gherkin tests, and can contain as many scenarios as you please.  
  * You can have more rows in your table after the first two, but they are ignored.
  * Text formatting (i.e. _italic_, *bold*) is ignored and can be used to emphasize


=Noteworthy Commentary=

  * I love using BDD-style tests - I find they are the perfect way to describe _User Stories_ just perfectly.  
  * If I find myself writing a gazillion BDD tests for a single user story, I wonder if that user story should be described using an Executable Use Case followed by sub-stories, described by the BDD tests

#summary How to Write Executable Use Case Fixtures

= Introduction =

Spectacular has an engine for parsing a table composed of user action and expectations and finding methods with `Annotations` that match those actions and expectations.  This concept it based on the same behavior in the JBehave library.

Rather than be restricted to keywords such as Given/When/Then, you can use the english language to whatever limit you choose, in the format of traditional Use Cases.


=Details=

Writing Executable Use Cases under Spectacular isn't really very different than with JBehave.  Given a traditional use case table:

|| User Flow:  Logging In ||
|| *User Action* || *Expectation* || *Comments* ||
|| User navigates to home page || User sees home page with articles || ||
|| User clicks "login" link || User sees login page requesting credentials || ||
|| User enters credentials and submits form || User sees personalized page with articles || Alternative Flow: Logging In With Bad Credentials ||

Spectacular will parse the table and read the first two columns from left to right in each row below the headers, starting with `User navigates to home page`, then to `User sees home page with articles`, and so on.  Each step (called "Flow" and "Expectation") is searched for in annotated code.  When it finds a match, it executes that code and passes in any parameters, if applicable.

For the above example, you may define a class such as the following:


{{{

package minderupt.sample.euc;

import minderupt.spectacular.executor.euc.Context;

@EUC
public class SampleEUCFlows {

    @Flow("User navigates to home page")
    public void userNavigatesToHomePage() {
    
        // do something useful, like drive a browser

    }

    @Expectation("User sees home page with articles")
    public void userSeesPageWithArticles(Context context) {
        
       // Assert user sees page with articles

    }


    
}


}}}

*Couple things to take note:*

  * If you want your class methods to be searched when walking through a Use Case, annotate the class with {{{ @EUC }}}


=Restrictions=

  * While you are free, of course, to use the `org.jbehave.scenario.JUnitScenario` Scenario class during JUnit testing, you cannot use your own Scenario class while your tests run in Spectacular.  We customize the Configuration and Scenario runners for JBehave.  Possibly in the future we'll try to make this more flexible but for now this is a restriction.
  * Per the documentation on writing JBehave tests, you need to specify the Step class in the header of your JBehave table.  
  * Right now, you can only specify a single Step class to hold your fixtures.  Working on a way to use more than 1, though I'm not even sure if that's a best practice for JBehave in general.

#summary Results of test

= Test Results =

Tests are currently output in HTML with the same content as the input spec HTML.  The tables where your tests are located are altered a bit to show the results of execution.


== Executable Use Case Results ==

|| User Flow:  Logging In ||
|| *User Action* || *Expectation* || *Comments* ||
|| User navigates to home page (SUCCESS) || User sees home page with articles (SUCCESS) || ||
|| User clicks "login" link (SUCCESS) || User sees login page requesting credentials (FAIL) InvocationException: Caused by: Assertion failed; did not see login page || ||
|| User enters credentials and submits form (NOT PERFORMED) || User sees personalized page with articles (NOT PERFORMED) || Alternative Flow: Logging In With Bad Credentials ||


Possible result values include:

|| *Result Value* || *Definition* ||
|| (SUCCESS) || The use case flow/expectation was successful, no errors ||
|| (PENDING) || No matching flow/expectation executable method was found, rest of use case ignored ||
|| (FAILURE) || Method threw an exception during this step, rest of use case ignored ||
|| (NOT PERFORMED) || Each step after a (PENDING) or (FAILURE) is ignored and labeled accordingly ||

Scenario: Logging in with correct credentials

  Given a user with username "bdduser" and password "bddpassword" (PASSED)
    And is an active user in the system (PASSED)
  When a visitor logs in with username "bdduser" and password "bddpassword" (PASSED)
  Then the visitor is logged in as a "User" (PASSED)


Scenario: Logging in with incorrect credentials

  Given no user exists with the username "bddbaduser" (PENDING)
  When a visitor logs in with username "bddbaduser" and password "bddbadpassword" (NOT PERFORMED)
  Then the visitor is not logged in (NOT PERFORMED)

Details about how to write Gherkin tests and their results can be found [http://jbehave.org/reference/latest/getting-started.html at the JBehave site]. Results are very similar to Executable Use Cases as above:

Possible result values include:

|| *Result Value* || *Definition* ||
|| (PASSED) || The step passed with no errors ||
|| (PENDING) || No matching step method was found, rest of steps ignored ||
|| (FAILURE) || Method threw an exception during this step, rest of steps ignored ||
|| (NOT PERFORMED) || Each step after a (PENDING) or (FAILURE) is ignored and labeled accordingly ||

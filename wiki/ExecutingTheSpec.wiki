#summary With specs in hand and fixture code written, let's run it!

= From the Command Line =

*First, put your test fixture (and any related/required libs) in Spectacular's classpath:*

For Windows:
`> set CLASSPATH_PREFIX=c:\path\to\your\libs.jar`

For Linux/Unix/Mac OS:
`> export CLASSPATH_PREFIX=/path/to/your/libs.jar`

*Then, run Spectacular with a few key command-line options:*

`> Spectacular -fixtures some.sample.package -specLocation file:path/to/spec.html`

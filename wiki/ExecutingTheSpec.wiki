#summary With specs in hand and fixture code written, let's run it!

= From the Command Line =

*First, put your test fixture (and any related/required libs) in Spectacular's classpath:*

For Windows:
`> set CLASSPATH_PREFIX=c:\path\to\your\libs.jar`

For Linux/Unix/Mac OS:
`> export CLASSPATH_PREFIX=/path/to/your/libs.jar`

*Then, run Spectacular with a few key command-line options:*

`> Spectacular -fixtures some.sample.package -specLocation file:path/to/spec.html`

|| *Command-Line Option* || *Required?* || *Explanation* ||
|| -help || No || Prints out a help menu of available command line options ||
|| -specLocation <uri>|| Yes || Location of the spec to test.  Must be in URI format (for local filesystem, use `file:/path/to/spec`, for specs on the web use `http://host.com/path/to/spec`, etc) ||
|| -fixtures <package/scripts> || Yes, for EUC.  No for others || If you have any executable use cases, this is the parent Java package that contains all your fixture code; for EUC fixture code in Groovy, prepend with `groovy:` (i.e. `groovy:/path/to/script.groovy`); for Selenese, prepend with `selenese:` (i.e. `selenese:/path/to/script.selenese`); for Ruby, prepend with `ruby:` (i.e. `ruby:/path/to/script.rb`) ||
|| -config <path to config> || No || Location of a Spring wiring config file if you want to replace any of the beans for any of the Spectacular steps (see Spectacular Architecture for more information).  You generally won't be using this. ||

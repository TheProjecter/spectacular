#summary With specs in hand and fixture code written, let's run it!

= From the Command Line =

*First, put your test fixture (and any related/required libs) in Spectacular's classpath:*

For Windows:
`> set CLASSPATH_PREFIX=c:\path\to\your\libs.jar`

For Linux/Unix/Mac OS:
`> export CLASSPATH_PREFIX=/path/to/your/libs.jar`

*Then, run Spectacular with a few key command-line options:*

`> Spectacular -fixtures some.sample.package -specLocation file:path/to/spec.html`

(you did remember to follow the install instructions in the QuickStartGuide right?)

Available command line options:



|| *Command-Line Option* || *Required?* || *Explanation* ||
|| -help || No || Prints out a help menu of available command line options ||
|| -specLocation <uri>|| Yes || Location of the spec to test.  Must be in URI format (for local filesystem, use `file:/path/to/spec`, for specs on the web use `http://host.com/path/to/spec`, etc) ||
|| -fixtures <package/scripts> || Yes, for EUC.  No for others || If you have any executable use cases, this is the parent Java package that contains all your fixture code; for EUC fixture code in Groovy, prepend with `groovy:` (i.e. `groovy:/path/to/script.groovy`); for Selenese, prepend with `selenese:` (i.e. `selenese:/path/to/script.selenese`); for Ruby, prepend with `ruby:` (i.e. `ruby:/path/to/script.rb`) ||
|| -config <path to config> || No || Location of a Spring wiring config file if you want to replace any of the beans for any of the Spectacular steps (see [Architecture Spectacular Architecture] for more information).  You generally won't be using this. ||
|| -projectXml <path to xml> || No || Location of a project-level XML file which can specify all of these command-line parameters for you.  See [ProjectXML Using a Project XML] documentation for more details.||
|| -reportLocation <path> || No. || Path to the location where you would like the report written. ||

If you are using [WritingExecutableUseCaseFixturesInSelenese Selenese] test fixtures, the following must be supplied to the command line (or in the [ProjectXML Project XML file]):

|| *Command-Line Option* || *Required?* || *Explanation* ||
|| -seleniumRCHost <hostname> || Yes, for Selenese tests.  No otherwise. || If you're using Selenese scripts, this is the hostname of the Selenium Remote Control Server. ||
|| -seleniumRCPort <port number> || Yes, for Selenese tests.  No otherwise. || If you're using Selenese scripts, this is the port number the Selenium Remote Control Server is listening on. ||
|| -seleniumRCStartupCommand <command> || Yes, for Selenese tests.  No otherwise. || If you're using Selenese scripts, this is [http://seleniumhq.org/docs/05_selenium_rc.html#specifying-the-path-to-a-specific-browser the startup command to selenium].  i.e. *firefox or *safari or *iehta ||
|| -seleniumRCInitialUrl <url> || Yes, for Selenese tests.  No otherwise. || If you're using Selenese scripts, this is the base URL of the system under test. ||

If you are _extending_ Spectacular with your own custom phase handlers (see [Architecture Spectacular Architecture]), you can specify which handler should be used with the following command-line arguments (not commonly used unless you're extending Spectacular or using a different plugin):


|| *Command-Line Option* || *Required?* || *Explanation* ||
|| -documentReader <arg> || No, unless you're _extending_ Spectacular || Bean name for document reader. ||
|| -artifactExtractor <arg> || No, unless you're _extending_ Spectacular || Bean name for artifact extractor ||
|| -decisionerAgent <arg> || No, unless you're _extending_ Spectacular || Bean name for Decisioner Agent ||
|| -preexecutorAgent <arg> || No, unless you're _extending_ Spectacular || Bean name for Pre-Executor Agent ||
|| -artifactExecutorAgent <arg> ||  No, unless you're _extending_ Spectacular || Bean name for Artifact Executor Agent ||
|| -reportBuilder <arg> ||  No, unless you're _extending_ Spectacular || Bean name for Report Builder ||
|| -reportWriter <arg> ||  No, unless you're _extending_ Spectacular || Bean name for Report Writer ||

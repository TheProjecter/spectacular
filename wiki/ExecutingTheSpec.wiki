#summary With specs in hand and fixture code written, let's run it!

= From the Command Line =

*First, put your test fixture (and any related/required libs) in Spectacular's classpath:*

For Windows:
`> set CLASSPATH_PREFIX=c:\path\to\your\libs.jar`

For Linux/Unix/Mac OS:
`> export CLASSPATH_PREFIX=/path/to/your/libs.jar`

*Then, run Spectacular with a few key command-line options:*

`> Spectacular -eucBasePackage some.sample.package -specLocation file:path/to/spec.html`

(you did remember to follow the install instructions in the QuickStartGuide right?)

Available command line options:

|| *Command-Line Option* || *Required?* || *Explanation* ||
|| -eucBasePackage _package name_ || No || If you have any executable use cases, this is the parent package that contains all your fixture code ||
|| -specLocation _path to spec_ || Yes || Location of your spec, using classpath:, file:, or http:/https:||
|| -config _path to config_ || No || Location of an alternate Spring wiring config file ||

#summary Writing FIT Fixtures in Spectacular

= Introduction =

FIT (Framework for Integrated Tests) is a way to express tests in a tabular format, using examples.  FIT works exactly the same in Spectacular as it does standalone.  Stand to show just how well written (and simple!  which equals great) it is.

=Details=

All the details for writing proper FIT Fixtures is fully documented at the [http://fit.c2.com/wiki.cgi?FieldGuideToFixtures FIT Fixture Field Guide].  Once you write the tables and specify a fixture classname, Spectacular will detect the table and execute FIT.


=Restrictions=

  * None, really.
